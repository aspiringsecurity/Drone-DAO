# Drone DAO

Ensure effective design, engineering and delivery of solution for detecting & managing UAVs & Drones using modular iot gateway device solution, Solana and Canto blockchain, Elusiv, IBC and Cosmos, setting up geo fences using predictive analytics, expert.ai nlp apis, automation, Ethereum & Filecoin eco-system tools.

Platform Features:

•Detection : Identifying the drones & UAVs in the video feed using object detection.

•Discovery : Logging the identities of the drones & UAVs flying in a particular air space at any instant of time, using exchange of unique identifiers.

•Geo-fencing : Discovering unlawful presence and raising alarms using the detection & discovery data.

•Monitoring : Looking out and reporting incidents based on event detection in visual data.

•Analysis : Analyzing route patterns and incidents.

•Drone Incident Reporting : Publish drone incident reports.

# Beneficiaries of Drone DAOs

1. Transport Management: An analytics and incident management platform for citizens, police officers and drivers to report and manage incidents, detect and prevent accidents on both mobile and web in a secure and simplified manner. With a mix of intelligent hardware, software on SAP Hana Database, Solana blockchain network with Drone DAOs, decentralized database, we provide intelligent feedback about drive quality and help analyze past incidents, as well as predict future incidents, enable road safety counseling. Further, we enable private payments for vehicle repair on Solana using Elusiv sdk and nft voting for the service providers using Drone Daos.

2. Integrated Water Management: Safer and more efficient surveys; Accurate, geo-referenced point clouds for measurement, 3d visualization and export. Conduct Volume measurements in the point cloud, create contour lines and digitize models for break lines; Use our quality report to assess and control data quality.

3. Real Estate: Show property in 3D on the web; Navigate through your model, observing property and surroundings in detail from an aerial perspective. Create customized fly through videos to share with clients or advertise your business.

4. Building Construction: With Geo-referenced outputs and data acquisition, easily monitor your sites over time using digital surface models and Orthomosaics. Measurements: Volume calculation in the 3D point cloud is intuitive, with adjustable base height and more for accurate earthwork measurements; Output are compatible with CAD software. Verify the as built site status against design models using current 2d and 3d data from our cloud services.


# Solana Blockchain and Elusiv Eco-system

1. Solana Information Explorer: We are using Solana Multicurrency web wallet and information explorer with data analytics powered by SocialCalc for managing information and payments to emergency service providers, maintenance and repair servicemen and also insuarnce and cab aggregator providers for availing their services. SocialCalc with Solana explorer enables tabulation, data organization and management, is an easy-to-use analysis tool that summarises core data and features of a Token or NFT such as chains used, origin, issuer, energy consumption, and minting method.  We also enable private payments for vehicle repair on Solana using Elusiv sdk and nft voting for the service providers using daos. 

Multi currency web wallet is very helpful in cases where the road incident involves tourists or foreign diplomats.

2. NFT creation and minting on Solana: We are also developing an NFT creation and minting system on Solana for NFC tags of automobiles.

3. Audio: We are extending and adapting the Audius layer on the Solana ecosystem to enable audio based streaming of an incident event. We are using the lighthouse SDK for storage.

4. Video: We are developing on the Huddle01 application layer and creating a bridge with the Solana blockchain to enable video conferencing and streaming on-chain. We are utilizing IPFS and Filecoin for storage purposes. We also plan to use Aptos along with Livepeer for developing a video command and control center and make it available via a bridge network.


# Canto, IBC and Cosmos Eco-system

1. Canto enables us to have a DAO infrastructure with minimal gas fees. That is very important both from the privacy and cost effectiveness front.

2. Cosmos interoperability with Ethereum like blockchains. Also, ability to use decentralize NFT voting for incident investigative system.

3. Ability to generate NFT and ease of identity management.

4. We are generating an NFT for NFC tags for drones and UAVs and spare parts at the time of service and repair workflows.

5. Identity management, ability to extend the solution using IBC and reducing misinformation at the time of Incident analysis and reporting are the key reasons for experimenting with Canto.
Overall, Canto enables investigative case management and incident reporting, identity management at the time of allocation of a case to a police officer, incident severity analysis based on the decentralize voting at the IBC chain.

# Canto Water Monitor

Our solution offers an Artificial Intelligence-based object detection system that utilizes blockchain solutions for sorting information obtained from a variety of water management bodies, cameras deployed at monitoring spots using drones and UAVs. Canto enables us to have a DAO infrastructure with minimal gas fees, which enables privacy and cost effectiveness for a citizen developer solution, Identity management, UI extensibility using Cadence, IBC. Features:


•Detection : Identifying the drones & UAVs in the video feed using object detection for water management.

•Discovery : Logging the identities of the drones & UAVs flying in a particular air space at any instant of time, using exchange of unique identifiers.

•Geo-fencing : Discovering unlawful presence and raising alarms using vital data with Cadence UI tools.

•Monitoring and Reporting: Looking out and reporting incidents based on event detection in visual data on Canto.

•Analysis : Analyzing route patterns and incidents.


Canto and Cosmos Smart Contracts, IBC: We are using Canto, IBC, Cosmos Smart Contracts for solving multiple challenges in detecting & managing UAVs & Drones using modular iot gateway device solution.

Canto enables us to have a DAO infrastructure with minimal gas fees. That is very important both from the privacy and cost effectiveness front.

Cosmos interoperability with Ethereum like blockchains. Also, ability to use decentralize NFT voting for incident investigative system.

Ability to generate NFT and ease of identity management.

We are generating an NFT for NFC tags for drone and UAV vehicles and spare parts at the time of service and repair workflows.

Identity management, ability to extend the solution using IBC and reducing misinformation at the time of Incident analysis and reporting are the key reasons for experimenting with Canto.

Canto analytics tooling: investigative case management and incident reporting, identity management at the time of allocation of a case to a government officer, incident severity analysis based on the decentralize voting at the IBC chain.

Cadence Composers: Our solution offers an Artificial Intelligence-based object detection system that utilizes Cadence composition for sorting information obtained from a variety of drone cameras, deployed at monitoring spots. This enables effective UI design for the flow of blockchain transactions, engineering and delivery of blockchain aided solution to enable:

•Detection : Identifying the drones & UAVs in the video feed using object detection.

•Discovery : Logging the identities of the drones & UAVs flying in a particular air space at any instant of time, using exchange of unique identifiers.

•Geo-fencing : Discovering unlawful presence and raising alarms using the detection & discovery data.

•Monitoring : Looking out and reporting incidents based on event detection in visual data.

•Analysis : Analyzing route patterns and incidents.

•Drone Incident Reporting : Publish drone incident reports.
